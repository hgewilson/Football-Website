<p>Despite Manchester City’s dominance over the past decade, their title hopes for this season appear to be at an all-time low, with bookmakers ranking them as third favourites and giving them only a 23.3% chance of reclaiming the Premier League. Man City slipped to 3rd last season which might sound respectable, but to regular Premier League watchers it was a clear sign of decline, with many feeling they were fortunate even to finish that high. Over the summer, Man City managed to bring in proven quality such as Serie A midfielder of the season Tijani Reijnders, promising French midfielder Rayan Cherki plus Ryan Aït-Nouri from Wolves and PSG Keeper Donnaruma as City look to strengthen all parts of the pitch. Pep also brought in Jurgen Klopp's former assistant Pep Ljinders as Pep seeks a new, more direct way of playing football, much like Klopp’s Liverpool sides who gave Man City so many problems over the years. This also comes after City brought in multiple additions in January including Abdukodir Khusanov and Omar Marmoush, two players who made significant contributions to the second half of City’s season. In fact, after these signings were made, City were the best team in the league until the end of the season, showing signs of promise for the years ahead. City lost the likes of Walker, De Bruyne, Gundogan, Ederson and Akanji as City clearly sought a rebuild of youth and energy to the team.
</p>

<p>With City’s main title rivals Liverpool and Arsenal significantly improving over the summer, the early signs are City will once again fall short of the 2 best teams in the league last season with City’s squad looking one of potential and excitement for the future rather than a ready-made squad prepared to compete this season. However, what Man City do have in their team are winners and players who still are seen as the best at what they do in the world. Many will argue Man City have the best keeper in the World, Donnaruma, the best midfielder in the world, Rodri, the best Striker in the world, Haaland, and the best coach in the world, Pep Guardiola. Man City clearly have the talent and if Pep can figure a way of making it all work, Man City certainly should not be overlooked. Let's remember that when it comes to the clutch part of the season, Man city always win. Overall, whilst Man City’s spine is strong and the team have many up and coming superstars such as Abdukidor Khusanov and Oscar Bobb, they aren’t ready to compete at the top again quite yet and therefore another 3rd place finish behind Liverpool and Arsenal is the most likely outcome for the 2025/26 premier league season
