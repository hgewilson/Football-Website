<p>Following the end of the transfer window, I will give some predictions for the upcoming Premier League season below, including some views from fans from selected clubs. If you disagree with anything, let us know on Instagram @ourjogabonito. </p>


<h1>1. Liverpool</h1>
<p>It's very difficult to predict against Liverpool after their title-winning season last year. They have strengthened their squad well in attack and at full back, overall looking an even stronger outfit than last year. Their only concerns will be at centre-back, where squad depth will be tested, and possibly defensive midfield if Gravenberch gets injured.</p>

<h1>2. Arsenal</h1>
<p>Arsenal have the best defence in the league by far, with a plethora of options in all defensive positions. Their concern will be scoring goals, especially in periods without Saka, although attacking signings Eze and Gyokeres should help breaking down compact defences.</p>
<p><em>Fan view from Toby: Whilst Arsenal have strengthened in terms of squad depth which was needed because recent seasons have been ruined by injuries, some of the similar problems from the last couple of seasons still exist including Arteta's approach to win games and his "prevent losing" mentality instead of trying to win, which ultimately leads to games being drawn that arsenal should be winning. Overall, this season, Arsenal's aim should be to win one of either the Champion's league or Premier league, but realistically winning the Premier league is less realistic than the Champions league, as Arsenal's tactics are more suited to knockout football as they prevent losing and can scrape out wins when under pressure.</em></p>

<h1>3. Manchester City</h1>
<p>Manchester City have made positive signings this window and have freshened up a squad that had begun to age last season. Their squad does seem weaker than both Arsenal and Liverpool, so I predict them to be some way behind the two.</p>
<p><em>Fan view from Reuben:read the full article <a href="City.htm">here</a></em></p>

<h1>4. Chelsea</h1>
<p>Chelsea are difficult to predict due to their inconsistency, but their squad is starting to mature into a really strong team. Joao Pedro seems to be a shrewd piece of business, and their midfield duo of Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez looks among the best in the world. However, in past seasons they have relied too much on Cole Palmer, and are prone to poor slumps in form.</p>

<h1>5. Tottenham</h1>
<p>Tottenham are another team that are difficult to predict, however their squad looks strong this season. Palhinia and Xavi Simons solve two of the biggest holes in their squad, and Thomas Frank should make Tottenham a stronger defensive force. Spurs would have wanted to add another left winger to the squad, and it remains to be seen how big of a hole Heung Min Son will leave this season.</p>
<p><em>Fan view from Jeff: My instinctive thought is that Tottenham will finish 6th because they will make significant improvements under Thomas Frank, but still won't have the depth to beat the big teams. Palhinia will address a weakness in last year's XI, and Kudus will make a large impact this season. Sonny will be missed in the dressing room more than he will be on the pitch.</em></p>

<h1>6. Newcastle</h1>
<p>Despite a poor start to the season and a difficult transfer window, Newcastle have the quality to climb back up the league table. Guimaraes and Tonali form a strong defensive midfield partnership in front of a settled and resolute back 4 (or 5). Eddie Howe has shown himself to be an astute tactician capable of elevating a decent squad to a good squad. A lot of their fortune will hinge on Woltemade and Wissa's ability to replicate what Isak has done in previous years.</p>

<h1>7. Nottingham Forest</h1>
<p>Mr Marinakis has had a very good transfer window, hanging on to all of his best players besides Elanga. Forest have invested in the squad heavily, with many attacking signings including Hutchinson, Bakwa, Ndoye and Kalimuendo, who should exceed Elanga's impact last season. Keeping Morgan Gibbs-White, albeit in controversial fashion, will be very important for Forest this season.</p>

<h1>8. Aston Villa</h1>
<p>Aston Villa are another team that have had a poor transfer window, being severely limited by Profit and Sustainability Rules. They have undeniable quality in the squad, but depth will be an issue. Their start to the season, combined with an underwhelming transfer window, should be cause for concern for Aston Villa fans.</p>

<h1>9. Brighton and Hove Albion</h1>
<p>In true Brighton fashion, many senior players have departed this summer to be replaced by a new, younger contingent. Brighton have made a large profit this summer, and while their squad seems weaker on the whole, Brighton will still be strong this season. Due to the age of the squad, Brighton are only going to get better, and this includes their manager, Fabian Hürzeler, who at 32 years old is going to improve as a manager as we move through the season.</p>

<h1>10. Everton</h1>
<p>Grealish has made an instant impact since joining Everton from Manchester City, managing to thread together the different pieces of their attack. Since the first dire performance at Leeds, Everton have come on in leaps and bounds. Their attack, consisting most notably of Grealish, Ndiaye and Drewsbury-Hall, now appears to be one of the most entertaining and exciting in the league.</p>

<h1>11. Manchester United</h1>
<p>Manchester United are an unknown quantity this season, with major issues going unaddressed in the transfer window, which are better detailed in this article: link. Signings in attack should help, and if Amorim gets the time he needs to impose his system Manchester United could see a climb up the table.</p>
<p><em>Fan view from Ed: Despite the disaster of last season I am cautiously optimistic about our chances this time around. The problem last year was that we didn’t score enough goals, so adding three attackers should solve that. Midfield remains an issue, which will probably make or break our season. Defensively I’m very happy, with the blend of rising stars and experienced players. Amorim has a lot of problems to sort out, but I believe we have the quality to push for Europe this season. 
</em></p>

<h1>12. Bournemouth</h1>
<p>Bournemouth lost the majority of their defence last season, with Zabarnyi, Huijsen and Kerkez all moving on to other clubs. However, they have kept hold of their best attacking players despite large interest, particularly in Semenyo. Their main asset is their manager, Adoni Iraola, who is among the best in the Premier League, and should lift a mediocre Bournemouth squad to a mid-table finish.</p>

<h1>13. Crystal Palace</h1>
<p>Crystal Palace have a very strong starting XI and manager, with players such as Adam Wharton, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Marc Guehi possessing undeniable quality. The loss of Eze and a lack of squad depth, combined with the extra rigour of the Europa Conference League, may wear Palace thin. Expect a downturn in form some point this season for Crystal Palace.</p>

<h1>14. Brentford</h1>
<p>Brentford have lost their two best players, captain, goalkeeper, and manager all within a season. Former set piece coach Keith Andrews will have a difficult job on his hands trying to keep this Brentford side up. Captain Nathan Collins will also have a large part to play in his side's year.</p>

<h1>15. Fulham</h1>
<p>Marco Silva has turned his Fulham team into a combative, aggressive group, led by Joachim Andersen and Bernd Leno. Despite this, squad depth will be an issue for Fulham this season, and they look short of attacking quality. Fulham will be hard to play against, but lack the players to build on a strong 2024-25 season.</p>

<h1>16. West Ham</h1>
<p>After a dire start to the season, it looked like it could be a bleak year for West Ham fans. However, a storming 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest demonstrated the quality West Ham possess. Lucas Paqueta and Jarrod Bowen will be very important this season.</p>
<p><em>Fan view from Jeremy: [I expect our season to be] Very up and down, [it] didn’t look hopeful at the start of this season, but after beating Nottingham forest it is looking better.
	I think we will stay mid table for the season, depending on how our new transfers perform.
</em></p>

<h1>17. Sunderland</h1>
<p>Sunderland have had a strong transfer window, replacing the majority of the squad that came up from the championship. This new look team seem to have gelled very quickly, and they now have a very strong blend of experience and youth. Sunderland should have just enough quality to stay up.</p>

<h1>18. Leeds</h1>
<p>Despite signing a team of giants and a strong first round performance against Everton, Leeds have lost too many of their players from last season, the loss of Manor Solomon being particularly pertinent. I am a big fan of Anton Stach in the midfield, but many of the other new signings are not premier league quality.</p>

<h1>19. Wolves</h1>
<p>Wolves have lost their two best players - Aït-Nouri and Cunha, to other sides in the Premier League. While there are spots of optimism through the squad, such as Strand-Larsen, Agbadou, Andre and Joao Gomes, the starting XI are not strong enough to escape the drop.</p>

<h1>20. Burnley</h1>
<p>Burnley were famous for their stalwart defence last season, conceding only 16 goals en-route to promotion. This defence has been torn apart unfortunately, losing James Trafford and CJ Egan-Riley during the Summer. Scott Parker has been given very little to work with by the Burnley board, and may be headed straight back to the championship.</p>
